        Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods 
        or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser.
        Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the 
        retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a 
        shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability
         and pricing at different e-retailers. An online shop evokes the physical
          analogy of buying products or services at a regular "bricks-and-mortar" 
          retailer or shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer 
          (B2C) online shopping. When an online store is set up to enable businesses 
          to buy from another businesses, the process is called business-to-business 
          (B2B) online shopping.
